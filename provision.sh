#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script will provision the services specified in the argument list,
# or all services if no arguments are provided.
#
# Specifying invalid services will cause the script to exit early.
# Specifying services more than once will cause them to be provisioned more
# than once.
#
# To allow services to be passed in through a Makefile target,
# services can be plus-sign-separated as well as space separated.
#
# Service(s) will generally be setup in the following manner
# (but refer to  individual ./provision-{service} scripts to be sure):
# 1. Migrations run,
# 2. Tenants—as in multi-tenancy—setup,
# 3. Service users and OAuth clients setup in LMS,
# 4. Static assets compiled/collected.
#
# DEVSTACK DEVELOPERS -- To add a service to provisioning:
#   * Create a provision-{service}.sh script for your new service.
#   * Add the name of the service to ALL_SERVICES.
#
# Example usages:
# ./provision.sh                          # Provision all services.
# ./provision.sh lms ecommerce discovery  # Provision these three services.
# ./provision.sh lms+ecommerce+discovery  # Same as previous command.
