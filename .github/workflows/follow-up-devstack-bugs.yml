            Follow-up checklist (for Arch-BOM usage)
            - [ ] Is the issue flaky or consistent?
            - [ ] Does it affect multiple people or multiple types of systems?
            - [ ] Update the devstack troubleshooting documentation page if necessary
              - [ ] Do we need a new troubleshooting section?
              - [ ] Did a troubleshooting section already exist, but it wasn't easy to find given the symptoms?
              - [ ] If a recurring issue, should we ticket an automated resolution in place of the doc?
