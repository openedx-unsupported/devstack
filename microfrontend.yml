    # Use `npm ci` rather than `npm install` for a few reasons:
    #
    # - Repeatability: Respect the currently checked out package
    #   versions rather than upgrading when package.json and
    #   package-lock.json don't match. (Two people using this at
    #   different times on the same commit should get the same
    #   results.)
    # - Immutability: Don't change the repo's working directory
    #   unexpectedly when there's a lock mismatch.
    #
    # Fail fast if package install fails to avoid mysterious
    # errors later.
