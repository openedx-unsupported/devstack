# Included into Makefile and exported to command environment.

# WHEN ADDING NEW OPTIONS TO THIS FILE:
# 1. Provide an explanation of what the option is for.
# 2. Explain what values it can be overriden to.
# 3. Set the default value with `?=` (i.e., "set if not already set") such that values
#    set in `options.local.mk` or passed in via the environment are not clobbered.

# Include local overrides to options.
# You can use this file to configure your Devstack. It is ignored by git.

# Defaults to parent of this repository.
