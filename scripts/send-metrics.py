"""
Python script to collect metrics on devstack make targets.

If the devstack user has consented to metrics collected, this script
calls the specified make target and records metrics about the target,
execution time, and other attributes that can be used to monitor the
usability of devstack. For more information:

https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AC/pages/2720432206/Devstack+Metrics

If environment variable ``DEVSTACK_METRICS_TESTING`` is present and non-empty, then
metrics will be annotated to indicate that the event occurred in the
course of running tests so that it does not pollute our main data. (TODO)
(Extra debugging information will also be printed, including the sent
event data.)
