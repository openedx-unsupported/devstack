| Are you sure you want to run this command for *all* Open edX services?  |
|                                                                         |
| Commands like "make dev.pull" will operate on a large default set of    |
| services and their dependencies. This can make your work take           |
| longerâ€”you're probably pulling down Docker images you don't need and    |
| taking up memory and CPU by running services you don't need for your    |
| work. You might even run into bugs in unrelated services.               |
|                                                                         |
| You may prefer to use commands like "make dev.pull.lms+studio" to       |
| target a smaller set of services.                                       |
|                                                                         |

| (And if you *really* want the default set of services, you can use      |
| commands like "make dev.pull.default".)                                 |
