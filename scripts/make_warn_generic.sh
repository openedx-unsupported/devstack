The command "make $target" will operate on a large default set of
services and their dependencies. This can make your task take longer
than necessary.

You may prefer to use something like "make $target.lms+studio" to
target a smaller set of services.  Learn more about the commands you
can run at:

  https://github.com/edx/devstack/blob/master/docs/devstack_interface.rst

Without an explicit list of services, many devstack Make targets pull
down Docker images you don't need or take up extra memory and CPU. You
might even run into bugs in unrelated services.

(If you *really* want the default set of services, you can use the
command "make $target.default".)

read -r -p $'(You can cancel the command now or press ENTER to continue.)\n'

make "$target.default"
