Workflow
========

Here's a common workflow you might use in devstack for feature development or debugging in an IDA.

These instructions are written using the LMS as an example. Replace ``lms`` with ``studio``, ``credentials``, ``discovery``, etc. as appropriate.

#. Get your IDA's repo ready for development.

   - You'll be developing from a git repo that is checked out to the same parent directory as the one devstack is in. For example, if you have ``~/edx-repos/devstack``, you'll be developing the LMS in ``~/edx-repos/edx-platform``.

   - Make sure your IDA's repo is checked out to the commit you want to use for development, and that that commit is based on an up to date branch, so that it matches the disk images devstack will pull.

#. Activate your devstack virtualenv. See the main Getting Started instructions if you don't already have one.
#. Launch your service in a clean state:

   #. Run ``make lms-down lms-pull lms-up`` to halt any running services and remove their containers, pull the latest disk images, and launch your service.
   #. Optionally, watch ``make lms-logs`` to follow the logs. This lets you see when the service finishes coming up, and prints the port it is listening on.

      - Your service is up when you see a block of messages that looks like the following::

          edx.devstack.lms                  | System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
          edx.devstack.lms                  | November 25, 2020 - 19:04:18
          edx.devstack.lms                  | Django version 2.2.17, using settings 'lms.envs.devstack_docker'
          edx.devstack.lms                  | Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:18000/
          edx.devstack.lms                  | Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

      - If the logs show warning messages about missing tables or needed migrations, run ``make lms-migrate`` and then continue

      - If there are complaints about import failures, Python package requirements may have changed since the last disk image. Run ``make lms-shell`` and then ``make requirements`` from inside the shell, then restart the service with ``make lms-restart``.

#. Your service should now be up and accessible, and you can develop in your IDA's repo. When you make changes on disk, a file watcher will restart the service in devstack. It may take a moment for the service to come back up with your changes.

   - For some changes, this auto-restarting is insufficient, and you'll need to make a change from inside ``make lms-shell`` (such as ``make requirements`` or a migrations or other management command) and then run ``make lms-restart`` from the outside.

#. When you're done, you can either run ``make lms-stop`` to shut down the service but leave the container intact (with requirements installations and other file changes preserved) or ``make lms-down`` to destroy the containers as well.

Variations
----------

Multiple services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're working on multiple services at a time, you can use Make targets of a different form that take a list of services. For example, if you want to pull images for ``lms``, ``studio``, and ``credentials``, you can run ``make dev.pull.lms+studio+credentials``. This will pull down images for the three services, as well as for all of their runtime dependencies.

You can also use the more tab-completion-friendly commands separately: ``make lms-pull studio-pull credentials-pull``.

Time-savers
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to pull down just the images for one service but not its dependencies, there is a ``without-deps`` variant for both pulling images and for bringing a service up, and for both service-leading and service-trailing Make target variants. For example, ``dev.up.without-deps.lms`` and ``lms-up-without-deps`` may both be used, where the former is more amenable to use with multiple services at the same time.
