Troubleshooting: Common Issues
##############################

Known Issues
============

File ownership change
---------------------

If you notice that the ownership of some (maybe all) files have changed and you
need to enter your root password when editing a file, you might
have pulled changes to the remote repository from within a container. While running
``git pull``, git changes the owner of the files that you pull to the user that runs
that command. Within a container, that is the root user - so git operations
should be ran outside of the container.

To fix this situation, change the owner back to yourself outside of the container by running:

.. code:: sh

  $ sudo chown <user>:<group> -R .

Running LMS commands within a container
---------------------------------------

Most of the ``paver`` commands require a settings flag. If omitted, the flag defaults to
``devstack``. If you run into issues running ``paver`` commands in a docker container, you should append
the ``devstack_docker`` flag. For example:

.. code:: sh

  $ paver update_assets --settings=devstack_docker

Resource busy or locked
-----------------------

While running ``make static`` within the ecommerce container you could get an error
saying:

.. code:: sh

  Error: Error: EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rmdir '/edx/app/ecommerce/ecommerce/ecommerce/static/build/'

To fix this, remove the directory manually outside of the container and run the command again.

No space left on device
-----------------------

If you see the error ``no space left on device``, Docker has run
out of space in its Docker.qcow2 file.

Here is an example error while running ``make dev.pull.<service>``:

.. code:: sh

   ...
   32d52c166025: Extracting [==================================================>] 1.598 GB/1.598 GB
   ERROR: failed to register layer: Error processing tar file(exit status 1): write /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/.git/objects/pack/pack-4ff9873be2ca8ab77d4b0b302249676a37b3cd4b.pack: no space left on device
   make: *** [pull] Error 1

Try this first to clean up dangling images:

.. code:: sh

   docker system prune -f  # (This is very safe, so try this first.)

If you are still seeing issues, you can try cleaning up dangling volumes.

1. Bring up all containers.

.. code:: sh

   make dev.up.large-and-slow

2. Remove all unused volumes. **Warning:** this will remove all Docker data on your system that is *not currently in use by a container*, which is why it's important to run the previous step. Otherwise, this will wipe out your Devstack data.

   docker volume prune -f

No such file or directory
-------------------------

While provisioning, some have seen the following error:

.. code:: sh

   ...
   cwd = os.getcwdu()
   OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
   make: *** [dev.provision.services] Error 1

This issue can be worked around, but there's no guaranteed method to do so.
Rebooting and restarting Docker does *not* seem to correct the issue. You can
try the following:

.. code:: sh

   # repeat the following until you get past the error.
   make stop
   make dev.provision.<service>

Memory Limit
------------

While provisioning, some have seen the following error:

.. code:: sh

   ...
   Build failed running pavelib.assets.update_assets: Subprocess return code: 137

This error is an indication that your docker process died during execution.  Most likely,
this error is due to running out of memory.  Try increasing the memory
allocated to Docker (Recommended: 8 CPUs, 10 GB Memory, 2GB Swap).

Docker is using lots of CPU time when it should be idle
-------------------------------------------------------

On the Mac, this often manifests as the ``hyperkit`` process using a high
percentage of available CPU resources.  To identify the container(s)
responsible for the CPU usage:

.. code:: sh

    make dev.stats

Once you've identified a container using too much CPU time, check its logs;
for example:

.. code:: sh

    make dev.logs.lms

The most common culprit is an infinite restart loop where an error during
service startup causes the process to exit, but we've configured
``docker-compose`` to immediately try starting it again (so the container will
stay running long enough for you to use a shell to investigate and fix the
problem).  Make sure the set of packages installed in the container matches
what your current code branch expects; you may need to rerun ``pip`` on a
requirements file or pull new container images that already have the required
package versions installed.

Missing git branches
--------------------

When trying to check out a branch, you may see an error like this::

    git checkout jj/REV-666-implement-evil-feature
    > error: pathspec 'jj/REV-666-implement-evil-feature' did not match any file(s) known to git

If you are sure you have (i) recently run ``git fetch`` and (ii) didn't misspell the
branch name, then it is possible your repository is set in "single-branch" mode, meaning
that it is configured to only fetch ``master``. Although devstack currently clones services'
repositories with all their branches, devstacks provisioned before September 2020
will start out with single-branch repositories. You check if your repository is in this
state by running ``git branch -r``. If you only see a couple of entries
(``origin/master`` and ``origin/HEAD``), then your local repository is in single-branch
mode.

You can manually reconfigure your repository to pull all branches by running these
commands from within the repository::

    git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
    git fetch origin
    git checkout jj/REV-666-implement-evil-feature
    > Switched to branch 'jj/REV-666-implement-evil-feature'.

General git troubleshooting
---------------------------

``git`` is powerful but complex; you may occasionally find your respository in a
confusing state. This problem isn't devstack-specific.

If you find yourself stuck, folks in the edX-internal or Open edX Slack workspaces may
be able to give you a hand.

Alternatively, if you are at a roadblock and
*don't care about any changes you've made to your local copy of the repository*
(i.e., you have pushed or otherwise saved your work elsewhere)
then you can always delete the repository and start over again::

    rm -rf ./<repository>
    git clone git@github.com:openedx/<repository>

Finally, if you regularly find yourself mystified by git, consider reading
through `Understanding Git Conceptually`_. It explains core Git principles in way
that makes it easier to use the simpler ``git`` commands more effectively
and easier to use the more complicated ``git`` commands when you have to.

Problems with shared directories
--------------------------------

If you have problems like shared directories not appearing as shared, or very
slow sync times (up to an hour), it might be due to symlinks.  Be sure that
your actual devstack working directory matches the directory listed in the
Resources - File Sharing section of the Docker preferences.  Using a symlink as
the current directory and sharing the real directory (or vice-versa) may work
erratically.

Missing module
--------------

Occasionally, you'll get errors like 'Cannot import name Name from module xyz'. This usually happens because the code and the image are out of sync. To fix this, first make sure you have the latest images and the latest code. These instructions are written using the LMS as an example. Replace lms with cms, credentials, discovery, etc. as appropriate.

#. Run ``make dev.stop.lms`` from devstack
#. To update your image, you can run ``make dev.pull.lms`` from devstack.
#. To get the latest code, you can run ``git fetch && git pull`` from the head of the code repository. If you are working on a branch, you may need to rebase it onto the latest master or main.
#. From devstack, run ``make dev.up.lms`` and ``make dev.logs.lms``
#. If the import error is still there, run ``make dev.shell.lms`` and then, from within the service container, run ``make requirements``
#. After doing this, it may Just Work or you may need to restart the service with ``make dev.restart-devserver.lms`` (run from devstack)

Missing tables/migrations/fields
--------------------------------
Another error you may get if the code and the image are out of sync is sql or Django ORM errors about missing tables or models not having a certain field. To fix this, make sure you have the latest images and latest code, similar to the steps for Missing Module. Once you have updated the image and code, run ``make dev.migrate.lms`` (or your other service) from devstack to apply the latest migrations. You shouldn't need to restart the webserver or container.

Demo course is empty in studio
------------------------------
After provisioning and opening Studio, you may see an empty outline for the demo course. This usually means there is a disconnect between the block ids in mySQL and the corresponding data in Mongo.

To fix, simply add a new subsection and publish. The act of publishing should reload the whole course correctly.

CORS error from login_refresh in MFE
------------------------------------
If you see "Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:18000/login_refresh' from origin 'http://localhost:2000' has been blocked by CORS policy: Request header field x-xsrf-token is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response" it usually means you don't have a valid session.

The fix is to get a new auth session. You can do any of the following:

1. Before navigating to your MFE, go to http://localhost:18000 to restart your logged in http session.
2. Clear your cookies
3. Refresh http://localhost:18000
4. Log in
5. Navigate back to the MFE

Missing vendor file node_modules/backbone.paginator/lib/backbone.paginator.js
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This message sometimes appears when provisioning. The root cause of this is as yet unknown but the most effective workaround seems to be
to shell into the LMS (``make lms-shell`` in devstack) and run ``npm ci``, followed by ``paver update_assets``.
