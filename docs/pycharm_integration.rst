PyCharm Integration
===================

The Professional edition of JetBrains `PyCharm`_ IDE, version 2017.1.2 or later,
can be used to develop and debug with Docker and Docker Compose.

See additional information and tips for `PyCharm IDE setup`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. You must complete all steps for provisioning your Docker Devstack environment
   in the `README`_ before proceeding with the PyCharm setup.

2. If you are on a Mac, make sure you are on a newer version than macOS
   Yosemite. A this time, this should work with either El Capitan or Sierra.

Before running Run or Debug in PyCharm
--------------------------------------

Every time you run/debug a server or test in PyCharm, you must first ensure the
following:

1. Ensure that all Docker images are stopped outside of PyCharm before starting
   a server or tests from inside PyCharm. PyCharm will potentially disable the
   start button with no further error when this problem occurs. See `Jetbrains
   ticket PY-22893`_.

2. If you are running with Docker Sync on a mac you will want to first run
   ``docker-sync start`` to run sync in the background before running any
   servers or tests.

Setup a Remote Interpreter
--------------------------

Follow the `vendor documentation`_ for the necessary steps to add a Docker
Compose remote interpreter. In the Remote Python Interpreter dialog,
use the following options:

- If you need to add a server (e.g. Docker for Mac), you should be able to Add and choose defaults.

  - On a Mac, you'll need to use "API URL: unix:///var/run/docker.sock" (with 3 slashes).

- Configuration files(s)

  - Docker Sync (Mac)

    - ``/LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose.yml`` (e.g.~/edx/devstack/docker-compose.yml)
    - ``/LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose-sync.yml``

  - Without Docker Sync

    - ``/LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose.yml`` (e.g.~/edx/devstack/docker-compose.yml)
    - ``/LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose-host.yml``

- Service: lms (or whatever IDE you wish to test)

- Environment variables:

  - ``DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE=/LOCAL/PARENT/PATH/TO/workspace`` (i.e.: Path to where your local repositories are cloned)

- Python interpreter path:

  - The remote path should be set to the service's virtual environment:

    - ``/edx/app/<SERVICE_NAME>/venvs/<SERVICE_NAME>/bin/python``

  - For example, the path would be the following for the Credentials Service:

    - ``/edx/app/credentials/venvs/credentials/bin/python``

  - For either lms or studio, you need to use edxapp:

    - ``/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python``

- PyCharm helpers path: Keep the default.

**Note**: For lms and studio (edx-platform), it will take a long time to
update skeletons (10 or more minutes). If you want to try a different
set of configuration (compose) files, we recommend you create a new one
so you can easily switch back to old without this delay.

**Warning**: When you change configuration files, the service drop-down gets
reset. Remember to restore to the IDA you wish to test.

Setup a Server Run/Debug Configuration
--------------------------------------

The setup for Server Run/Debug Configurations depends on the service.

Server Run/Debug Configuration for an IDA (not LMS or Studio)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring the interpreter, add a new `Django Server Run/Debug
Configuration`_, with the following specific values.

The host should always be set to ``0.0.0.0`` so that Django accepts
requests from external clients (e.g. your Docker host). The port should
be set to the service-specific port from the table above.

*Note*: See next section for additional changes needed for LMS and
Studio.

Setup a Server Run/Debug Configuration for LMS or Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For LMS and Studio, the setup is a hack because we (unfortunately)
modified ``manage.py``.

After configuring the interpreter, add a new `Django Server Run/Debug
Configuration`_, with the following specific values.

1. Leave host/port blank

2. Additional options: runserver 0.0.0.0:18000 (or runserver
   0.0.0.0:18010)

3. Custom run command: lms (or cms)

4. Environment variables, add the following for lms/studio:

   - ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lms.envs.devstack_docker`` (or
     cms.envs.devstack_docker)
   - ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1``

5. Python Interpreter: Choose the Docker Compose interpreter for this
   service.

6. Working directory: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

7. Path mappings (add mapping):

   - Local path: /LOCAL/PATH/TO/edx-platform (e.g. ~/edx/edx-platform)
   - Remote path: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

8. Deselect "Add content..." and "Add source..."

Setup a Run/Debug Configuration for python tests
------------------------------------------------

The setup for a Run/Debug Configurations for python tests depends on the
service.

**Tip**: You can adjust the default configuration with settings you are most
likely to replicate.

Setup a Run/Debug Configuration for python tests for an IDA (not LMS or Studio)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run and debug unit tests, create a **"Django tests"** type Run/Dubug
configuration with the following options:

1. Target: lms.djangoapps.grades.tests.test_grades:TestGradeIteration

2. Environment Variables:

    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lms.envs.test_docker
    - DISABLE_MIGRATIONS=1
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

3. Working directory: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

4. Path mappings (add mapping):

   - Local path: LOCAL/PATH/TO/edx-platform (e.g. ~/edx/edx-platform)
   - Remote path: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

5. Deselect "Add content..." and "Add source..."

Setup a Run/Debug Configuration for python tests for LMS or Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run and debug unit tests, create a **"Django server"** type Run/Dubug
configuration (not "Django tests" as is done for IDAs) with the following
options:

1. Leave host/port blank

2. Additional Options: --settings test_docker test lms/djangoapps/courseware/tests/test_views.py

3. Check "Custom run command:" and enter either ``lms`` or ``cms`` in to the text box.

4. Environment Variables:

    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=**lms.envs.test_docker** (or
      cms.envs.test_docker)
    - DISABLE_MIGRATIONS=1
    - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

5. Python Interpreter: Choose the Docker Compose interpreter for this
   service.

6. Working directory: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

7. Path mappings (add mapping):

   - Local path: LOCAL/PATH/TO/edx-platform (e.g. ~/edx/edx-platform)
   - Remote path: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform

8. Deselect "Add content..." and "Add source..."

Currently not supported for PyCharm Development

- Debugging for BokChoy
- Debugging for JavaScript
- Cython for fasterdebug

Troubleshooting
---------------

General Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Ensure that you have fulfilled all of the `Prerequisites`_.

2. Ensure you have completed all steps in `Before running Run or Debug in
   PyCharm`_ each time you run the server or tests.

3. PyCharm is often fixing bugs around the relatively new docker-compose
   integration.  If PyCharm has an update, install it.

Can't create Python SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While working in PyCharm, you could see the following error:

.. code-block::

   The command '/bin/sh -c mv /user/bin/docker-compose /user/bin/docker-compose-original' returned a non-zero code: 1

This issue has been fixed in PyCharm 2017.1.2.

Project Interpreter has no packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you had added an interpreter that was working, but you can no longer see a
list of packages for it under Preferences, you may need to refresh it.

One way to do this is to follow these instructions:

1. Go to Preferences => Project Interpreter

2. Click the "..." button to the right of the "Project interpreter:" drop-down,
   and choose "More...".

3. Click the Edit button (pencil icon) at the bottom for the broken interpreter,
   and then click OK on all dialogs, without making any edits.
