# edX Devstack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/edx/devstack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/edx/devstack)

Get up and running quickly with edX services.

If you are seeking info on the Vagrant-based devstack, please see
<https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Devstack>.  This
project is meant to replace the traditional Vagrant-based devstack with a
multi-container approach driven by [Docker Compose][]. It is still in the
alpha/beta testing phase. Support for this project is limited at the moment, so
it may take a while to respond to issues.

You should run any Make targets described below on your local machine, _not_
from within a VM.


## Prerequisites

This project was developed and tested using **Docker 1.13+**. If you are using
macOS, please use [Docker for Mac][].  Previous Mac-based tools (e.g.
boot2docker) are not supported.

[Docker for Windows][] may work but has not been tested and is _not supported_.


### Docker Sync

Docker for Mac has known filesystem issues that significantly decrease
performance. In order to mitigate these issues, we use [Docker Sync][] to
synchronize file data from the host machine to the containers.

If you are using macOS, please follow the [Docker Sync installation instructions][]
before provisioning.


## Getting Started

All of the services can be run by following the steps below. Note that since we
are running many containers, you should configure Docker with a sufficient
amount of resources. Our testing found that [configuring Docker for Mac][] with
2 CPUs and 4GB of memory works well.

1.  The Docker Compose file mounts a host volume for each service's executing
    code. The host directory is defaults to be a sibling of this directory. For
    example, if this repo is cloned to `~/workspace/devstack`, host volumes
    will be expected in `~/workspace/course-discovery`,
    `~/workspace/ecommerce`, etc. These repos can be cloned with the command
    below.

    ```sh
    make dev.clone
    ```

    You may customize where the local repositories are found by setting the
    DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE environment variable.

2.  Run the provision command, if you haven't already, to configure the various
    services with superusers (for development without the auth service) and
    tenants (for multi-tenancy).

    The username and password for the superusers are both "edx". You can access
    the services directly via Django admin at the `/admin/` path, or login via
    single sign-on at `/login/`.

    Provision using docker-sync (recommended for macOS users)
    ```sh
    make dev.sync.provision
    ```

    Default (non-macOS users)
    ```sh
    make dev.provision
    ```

3.  Start the services. This command will mount the repositories under the
    DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE directory.

    _Note: it may take up to 60 seconds for the LMS to start_

    Start using docker-sync (recommended for macOS users)
    ```sh
    make dev.sync.up
    ```

    Default (non-macOS users)
    ```sh
    make dev.up
    ```

After the services have started, if you need shell access to one of the
services, run `make <service>-shell`. For example to access the
Catalog/Course Discovery Service, you can run:

```sh
make discovery-shell
```

To see logs from containers running in detached mode, you can either use
"Kitematic" (available from the "Docker for Mac" menu), or by running the
following:

```sh
make logs
```

To reset your environment and start provisioning from scratch, you can run:

```sh
make destroy
```


## Usernames and Passwords

The provisioning script creates a Django superuser for every service.

```
Email: edx@example.com
Username: edx
Password: edx
```

The LMS also includes demo accounts. The passwords for each of these accounts
is `edx`.

| Username | Email                |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| audit    | audit@example.com    |
| honor    | honor@example.com    |
| staff    | staff@example.com    |
| verified | verified@example.com |


## Service URLs

Each service is accessible at `localhost` on a specific port. The table below
provides links to the homepage of each service. Since some services are not
meant to be user-facing, the "homepage" may be the API root.

| Service           | URL                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Credentials       | <http://localhost:18150/api/v2/>    |
| Catalog/Discovery | <http://localhost:18381/api-docs/>  |
| E-Commerce/Otto   | <http://localhost:18130/dashboard/> |
| LMS               | <http://localhost:18000/>           |
| Studio/CMS        | <http://localhost:18010/>           |


## Useful Commands

Sometimes you may need to restart a particular application server. To do so,
simply use the ```docker-compose restart``` command:

```sh
docker-compose restart <service>
```

`<service>` should be replaced with one of the following:

* credentials
* discovery
* ecommerce
* lms
* studio

## Marketing Site

Docker Compose files useful for integrating with the edx.org marketing site are available. This will NOT be useful to
those outside of edX. For details on getting things up and running, see
https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/Marketing+Site.

## PyCharm Integration

A number of edX engineers develop using [PyCharm][]. As of version 2017.1, JetBrains has greatly improved PyCharm's
integration with Docker and Docker Compose. Note that Docker integration is only supported in the Professional edition.

See additional information and tips for [PyCharm IDE setup][].

**Warning**: It is important to ensure that all Docker images are stopped outside of PyCharm before starting a server or
tests from inside PyCharm.  PyCharm will potentially disable the start button with no further error when this problem
occurs.  See [Jetbrains ticket PY-22893][].

**Warning**: If you are on a Mac, make sure you are on a newer version than macOS Yosemite.  A this time, this should
work with either El Capitan or Sierra.


### Setup a Remote Interpreter

Follow the [vendor documentation][] for the necessary steps to add a Docker Compose remote interpreter.  In the Remote
Python Interpreter dialog, use the following options:

* If you need to add a server (e.g. Docker for Mac), you should be able to Add and choose defaults.
   * On a Mac, you'll need to use "API URL: unix:///var/run/docker.sock" (with 3 slashes).
* Configuration files(s), choose:
   * /LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose.yml (e.g. ~/edx/devstack/docker-compose.yml)
   * /LOCAL/PATH/TO/devstack/docker-compose-host.yml
* Service: lms (or whatever IDE you wish to test)
* Environment variables:
   * DEVSTACK_WORKSPACE=/LOCAL/PARENT/PATH/TO(/devstack) (e.g. ~/edx)
* Python interpreter path:
   * The remote path should be set to the service's virtual environment:
       * /edx/app/<service>/venvs/<service>/bin/python
   * For example, the path would be the following for the Credentials Service:
       * /edx/app/credentials/venvs/credentials/bin/python
   * For either lms or studio, you need to use edxapp:
       * /edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python
* PyCharm helpers path: Keep the default.

**Note**: For lms and studio (edx-platform), it will take a long time to update skeletons (10 or more minutes).  If you
  want to try a different set of configuration (compose) files, I recommend you create a new one so you can easily
  switch back to old without this delay.
**Warning**: We have not yet gotten this to work with docker-sync.  In theory, you would replace docker-compose-host.yml
  above with docker-compose-sync.yml.  You will also need to first run "docker-sync start" to run sync in the background.
**Warning**: When you change configuration files, the service dropdown gets reset.  Remember to restore to the IDA you wish
  to test.


### Setup a Server Run/Debug Configuration

After configuring the interpreter, you should setup a [Django Server Run/Debug Configuration][]. Note that there are
some specific values that should be used for this configuration.

The host should always be set to `0.0.0.0` so that Django accepts requests from external clients (e.g. your Docker
host). The port should be set to the service-specific port from the table above.

*Note*: See next section for additional changes needed for LMS and Studio.

### Setup a Server Run/Debug Configuration for LMS or Studio

For LMS and Studio, the setup is a hack because we (unfortunately) modified `manage.py`. (We should fix this!!!)

Add a new Run/Debug Configuration of type "Django server", with the following options:

1. Leave host/port blank
2. Additional options: runserver 0.0.0.0:18000 (or runserver 0.0.0.0:18010)
3. Custom run command: lms (or cms)
4. Environment variables, add the following for lms/studio:
    * DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lms.envs.devstack_docker (or cms.envs.devstack_docker)
    * PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
5. Python Interpreter: Choose the Docker Compose interpreter for this service.
6. Working directory: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform
7. Path mappings (add mapping):
    * Local path: /LOCAL/PATH/TO/edx-platform (e.g. ~/edx/edx-platform)
    * Remote path: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform
8. Deselect "Add content..." and "Add source..."

### Setup a Django tests Run/Debug Configuration for LMS or Studio

To run and debug unit tests, create a "Django tests" type Run/Dubug configuration with the following options:

1. Target: lms.djangoapps.grades.tests.test_grades:TestGradeIteration
2. Environment Variables:
   * DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lms.envs.test_docker
   * DISABLE_MIGRATIONS=1
   * PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
3. Working directory: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform
4. Path mappings (add mapping):
    * Local path: LOCAL/PATH/TO/edx-platform (e.g. ~/edx/edx-platform)
    * Remote path: /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform
5. Deselect "Add content..." and "Add source..."

**Tip**: You can adjust the default configuration if you will be replicating this.

# TODO: Fix Cython for debug

## Remaining Work

There is still work to be done before this is ready for full release to the
Open edX community. Here are the major items:

* [ ] Align with or revise [OEP-5][]
* [ ] Finish provisioning all services
* [ ] Load demo data
* [ ] PyCharm debugging
* [x] Merge [devstack settings for edxapp][], and reactivate host volume


## How do I build images?

We are still working on automated image builds, but generally try to push new images every 3-7 days. If you want to
build the images on your own, the Dockerfiles are available in the `edx/configuration` repo.

NOTES

1. edxapp is the only service whose changes have been merged to the master branch.
2. edxapp uses the `latest` tag. All other services use the `devstack` tag.


```sh
git checkout master
git pull
docker build -f docker/build/edxapp/Dockerfile . -t edxops/edxapp:latest
```

```sh
git checkout clintonb/docker-devstack-idas
git pull
docker build -f docker/build/ecommerce/Dockerfile . -t edxops/ecommerce:devstack
```

The build commands above will use your local configuration, but pull application code from the master branch of the
application's repository. If you would like to use code from another branch/tag/hash, modify the `*_VERSION` variable
that lives in the `ansible_overrides.yml` file beside the `Dockerfile`.

For example, if you wanted to build tag `release-2017-03-03` for the E-Commerce Service, you would modify
`ECOMMERCE_VERSION` in `docker/build/ecommerce/ansible_overrides.yml`.
